## Hi - I'm Joe.
(voolyvex is a pretty cool sounding word invented by my nephew)

### Who Am I
I am a GIS and software engineering professional focused on data integration,
automation, and system reliability.

I bring curiosity and a broad set of skills. I enjoy turning messy
problems into reliable solutions.



### Work Style
I enjoy working at the intersection of (geospatial) data, software systems, and
infrastructure. When designing solutions, I tend to think further ahead than
what’s typical in the planning phase.

  ▸ _Goal/outcome-oriented_: I like clear requirements and knowing what success looks like  
  ▸ _Responsible owner_: I can manage projects E2E with clean architectures  
  ▸ _Efficient lead_: Comfortable leading technical direction without unnecessary process  
  ▸ _Tool-agnostic_: I focus on patterns rather than platforms  
  ▸ _Adaptable_: Familiar with Agile, DevOps, Waterfall, Kanban, Lean Startup, CI/CD, and related 
  practices

### Beyond Assumptions

> **Colleague:** “That’s really thinking outside the box.”  
> **Me:** “What box?”
>

### Communication Style
Collaborative, approachable, and always willing to help troubleshoot or mentor. 
Besides simply getting my work done,  
I aim to improve overall team capability.

### Current Activities
University coursework.  
  ▸ DevOps fundamentals (CI/CD, infrastructure concepts, MLOps)  
  ▸ C programming and systems-level thinking  
  (strengthening my low- and high-level understanding of performance and reliability)  
More studying.  
  ▸ the mathematical foundations of computing  
  ▸ AI/Machine Learning, Cloud computing, Container orchestration, Hardware  
### Hobbies and Interests
I'm a sponsored chess expert, former state champ, and coach. I create/design/build/do things  
in my free time: audio recordings, woodworking, personal coding projects,  
collecting/modding old electronics, creative writing and random art projects.  
I enjoy riding my Kona gravel bike and playing billiards (when I have time).
