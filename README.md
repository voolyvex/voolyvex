## Hi - I'm voolyvex, but you can call me Joe.
(voolyvex is a pretty cool sounding word invented by my nephew)

### Whoami
I am a GIS and software engineering professional focused on data integration, automation, and system reliability. ![SwissknifeSwitzerlandwithaknifeGIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/675c2ce5-cfe3-4f13-a0c9-0b2e0432a81e)
I have an engineering mentality (i.e. I think in terms of solving problems) and use my curiosity and creativity where others get stuck. Like a Swiss Army knife, I have a vast set of skills that I can utilize across the tech stack.

### Work Style
I enjoy working at the intersection of (geospatial) data, software systems, and infrastructure. 
I am.... 

-_Goal/outcome-oriented_: I like to have clear requirements and to know what success looks like/

-_Proud owner_: I can manage projects E2E. I like clean architectures/documented workflows

-_Efficient lead_: Comfortable leading technical direction without unnecessary process

-_Tool-agnostic_; I focus on patterns rather than platforms
-_Adaptable_: familiar with many different styles/methodologies/techniques/practices (Agile, DevOps, Waterfall, KanBan, LEAN Startups, CI/CD, pomodoro, etc...)

### Comm style
Collaborative, approachable, and always willing to help troubleshoot or mentor. Besides just getting my work done, I aim to improve overall team capability.

### Creative problem solving
## Colleague: "Wow, Joe, that's really thinking outside the box." Me: "What box?"

### Problem Domains
-Utilities (electric, gas, water)
-Transportation/Logistics
-Natural Resources/Environmental/Health
-Government systems
-Data engineering/pipelines
-Enterprise GIS
-your industry/domain: _______________(?)

### Technical Proficency areas
A few core skill areas:
  -GIS/Spatial Data (ArcGIS, PostGIS, QGIS)
  -ETL/ELT pipelines (Python, SQL, Powershell, workflow orchestration)
  -Databases/data management/data quality, validation
  -System integration, APIs, Full-stack Engineering
  -Operating Systems (Windows, Linux)

### Current Activities

University coursework in:
  -DevOps fundamentals (CI/CD, infrastructure concepts)
  -C programming and systems-level thinking
Strengthening my low- (and high-) level understanding of performance and reliability. Also studying currently: 
  -the mathematical foundations of computing

Outside of Work (lots of hobbies!)
I'm a sponsored chess expert (and coach sometimes). I'm an avid billiards player (when I have time). I also enjoy creating things, audio recording, construction projects, and collecting/modding old electronics.
