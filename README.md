## Hi - I'm voolyvex, but you could call me Joe.
(voolyvex is a pretty cool sounding word invented by my nephew)

I am a GIS and software engineering professional focused on data integration, automation, and system reliability. <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/675c2ce5-cfe3-4f13-a0c9-0b2e0432a81e"

I have an engineering mentality (i.e. I think in terms of solving problems) and use my curiosity and creativity where others get stuck. Like a Swiss Army knife, I have a vast set of skills that I can utilize across the tech stack.

### Work Style
I enjoy working at the intersection of (geospatial) data, software systems, and infrastructure. 

  _Goal/outcome-oriented_: I like to have clear requirements and to know what success looks like

  _Proud owner_: I can manage projects E2E. I like clean architectures/documented workflows

  _Efficient lead_: Comfortable leading technical direction without unnecessary process

  _Tool-agnostic_; I focus on patterns rather than platforms
  
  _Adaptable_: Familiar with Agile, DevOps, Waterfall, Kanban, LEAN Startups, CI/CD, and related practices

### Communication style
Collaborative, approachable, and always willing to help troubleshoot or mentor. Besides just getting my work done, I aim to improve overall team capability.

### Creativity

> ### **Me:** “What box?”

### Current Activities

University coursework in:
  -DevOps fundamentals (CI/CD, infrastructure concepts, MLOps)
  -C programming and systems-level thinking
Strengthening my low- and high-level understanding of performance and reliability. Also studying currently: 
  -the mathematical foundations of computing
Keeping up with tech trends in:
  -AI/Machine Learning, Cloud computing, Container orchestration, Hardware
### Outside of Work 
#### (lots of hobbies)
I'm a sponsored chess expert (and coach sometimes). I enjoy billiards (when I have time). I also enjoy creating things, audio recording, construction projects, collecting/modding old electronics.
